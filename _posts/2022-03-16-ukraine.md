Here are a couple of ways to support the Ukraine people in their noble fight against Russia:

* [Donate crypto](https://donate.thedigital.gov.ua/) - The **Aid for Ukraine** initiative was created by the [Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine](https://donate.thedigital.gov.ua/), [FTX](https://ftx.com/), and [Everstake](https://everstake.one/). 
* There are many other ways to help, including some found in [this Global Citizen post](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/ways-to-help-ukraine-conflict/).  

>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 
>(Ephesians 6:10-20)
