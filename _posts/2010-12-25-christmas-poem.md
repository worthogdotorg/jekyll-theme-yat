Home is where the heart is  
Home is where it stays  
Home is where I want to be  
Home on Chritmas Day  

A day to feast and drink  
A day to fill our plates  
A day to be with loved ones  
A day to celebrate  

To celebrate the memories  
of those who are away  
To celebrate this holiday  
To celebrate, and pray  

To pray for journeys safe  
Pray for bounty great  
To pray to end this poem  
So our bellies we can sate.
