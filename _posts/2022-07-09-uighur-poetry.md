>"In this forgotten place I have no lover’s touch<br>
Each night brings darker dreams, I have no amulet<br>
My life is all I ask, I have no other thirst<br>
These silent thoughts torment, I have no way to hope

>Who I once was, what I’ve become, I cannot know<br>
Who could I tell my heart’s desires, I cannot say<br>
My love, the temper of the fates I cannot guess<br>
I long to go to you, I have no strength to move

>Through cracks and crevices I’ve watched the seasons change<br>
For news of you I’ve looked in vain to buds and flowers<br>
To the marrow of my bones I’ve ached to be with you<br>
What road led here, why do I have no road back home”
