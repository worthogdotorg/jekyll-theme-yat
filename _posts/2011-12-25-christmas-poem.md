[Here is a glimpse](https://youtu.be/YuFVAS7PXBs) of our family celebration. And here's the poem, read before Christmas dinner.

**Christmas**,  
a time for celebration.  
Celebrating the company of family,  
all of us together, here, now.  

Celebrating the memory  
of dearly departed loved ones.  

Celebrating life.  
Celebrating faith.  
Celebrating this paradise on earth.  

Celebrating this great repast  
which we are so fortunate  
and blessed  
to be sharing with one another.  

So, we celebrate.  
It is Christmas.
