I'm nearly always disappointed by expensive cocktails, with the sole exception being a well made gin martini.  This drink is named after my father ("Pancho").  He never had the opportunity to drink this elixer, but I know that he would have loved it.  The alchemy starts with this (easily doubled if you're drinking with your new best amigo):
<!--more-->
* 2 parts good mezcal or gin
* 1.5 parts fresh squeezed lime juice
* 1 part brine from a [good ferment](http://ozuke.com/the-other-escabeche/) (your local favorite fermenter might sell you some brine)
* .5 parts simple syrup
* (optional) a splash of bitters (I use homemade rhubarb bitters)  
* (optional) fresh mint leaves
* (optional) [sal de gusano](https://hablemosdeinsectos.com/sal-de-gusano/#:~:text=Lo%20que%20se%20conoce%20al%20respecto%20como%20sal,cuenta%20otro%20ingrediente%20como%20el%20chile%20de%20Ã¡rbol.), [sal de maguey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguey_worm), or whatever interesting non-iodized salt you have around
* ice cubes

Throw everything except the salt and a few mint leaves into your cocktail shaker, shake it long enough to sing all the words of [La Bamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bZ_-XuyM5Y) that you remember (about 30 seconds, or until the shaker is damn cold).  Put some salt around the rim of your glass.  Pour.  Enjoy.
