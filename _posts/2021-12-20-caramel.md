When my sister saw this photo, she wanted the recipe.  [Here it is](https://myrecipeconfessions.com/homemade-candy/soft-homemade-caramels/), sis!  A few mod's:
<!--more-->

* I used 1.5t of vanilla
* I added 1t of blackstrap molasses in step #2
* I used a candy thermometer to get the caramel to the soft-ball stage, which seems a little more precise than the cold water test (true in baking, true in candy making) 
* After it was cooled, we added flaked salt to the top of each caramel square before wrapping

There's a [recipe for homemade caramel apples](https://myrecipeconfessions.com/desserts/the-best-homemade-caramel-apples/) on the same site.  I tried it.  It's great (with the same mod's as above, except for the flaked salt).  Come Halloween, you owe it to yourself to make caramel apples for all the good people in your life.
