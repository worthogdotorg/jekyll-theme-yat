To 2 cups of well rinsed, good beans from the Colorado highlands (or lesser beans from somewhere else), add 7 cups of cold water, half an onion (or a couple of crushed garlic cloves), a small dried chili, and some [epazote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphania_ambrosioides) or some cilantro stems. Cook on low setting for about 5 hours. When the beans are cooked to your taste, turn off the crock pot and add a couple of teaspoons of
ketchup, a teaspoon of cider vinegar, and salt to your taste. Like any soup or stew, they are better a day later.

If you want to cook more or less beans, the ratio of beans to water is 1:3.5, *exactly and approximately*.
Soaking your beans, adding epazote, or any other methods proposed to prevent you from [farting](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/fart-words-and-euphemisms/fizzle) are all fiction, lies and wishful thinking. You will fart. Enjoy it.

Serve in a bowl with some aguacate, cebolla, and a little cilantro.  Or get extravagant and do something like this...
