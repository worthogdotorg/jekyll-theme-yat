Christmas is come and we are all here again  
To rejoice and celebrate with family and friends.

There's plentiful food and a bounty of gifts  
But let's pause and remember those dearly missed.

So with kind hearts, and charity, and good grace as our guide  
We celebrate, merrily, loved ones by our side.
