We’re greeted at first  
By dads outdoor lights  
Then moms stockings and tree  
Such a beautiful sight!

Raw eggs in our nog  
We drink without fear  
The eggnog won’t kill us  
It brings Christmas cheer!

Then there’s Mom and Dad’s gifts  
What’s left to bring?  
They’ve been spoiled for years  
They have everything!

They have grandkids, good health  
They have a beautiful home  
We walk this earth knowing  
We’re never alone.

Remembering loved ones  
Those who’ve passed on  
Hearts full of memories  
Remembrances fond.

If I could pray for more still  
Dear God if you please  
Good health and good tidings  
And more days like these

A Christmas prayer and a poem  
All this talk’s getting old  
Now let’s enjoy our meal  
Our food’s getting cold!
