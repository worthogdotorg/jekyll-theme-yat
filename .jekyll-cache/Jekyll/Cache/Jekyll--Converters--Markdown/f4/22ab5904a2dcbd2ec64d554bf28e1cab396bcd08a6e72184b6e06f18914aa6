I" <p>When my sister saw this photo, she wanted the recipe.  <a href="https://myrecipeconfessions.com/homemade-candy/soft-homemade-caramels/">Here it is</a>, sis!  A few modâ€™s:
<!--more--></p>

<ul>
  <li>I used 1.5t of vanilla</li>
  <li>I added 1t of blackstrap molasses in step #2</li>
  <li>I used a candy thermometer to get the caramel to the soft-ball stage, which seems a little more precise than the cold water test (true in baking, true in candy making)</li>
  <li>After it was cooled, we added flaked salt to the top of each caramel square before wrapping</li>
</ul>

<p>Thereâ€™s a <a href="https://myrecipeconfessions.com/desserts/the-best-homemade-caramel-apples/">recipe for homemade caramel apples</a> on the same site.  I tried it.  Itâ€™s great (with the same modâ€™s as above, except for the flaked salt).  Come Halloween, you owe it to yourself to make caramel apples for all the good people in your life.</p>
