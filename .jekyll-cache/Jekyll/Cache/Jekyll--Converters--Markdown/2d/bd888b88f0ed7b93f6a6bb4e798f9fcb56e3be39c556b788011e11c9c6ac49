I"°<p>When my sister saw this photo, she wanted the recipe.  <a href="https://myrecipeconfessions.com/homemade-candy/soft-homemade-caramels/#comments">Here it is</a>, sis!  A few modâ€™s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I used 1.5t of vanilla</li>
  <li>I added 1t of blackstrap molasses in step #2</li>
  <li>I used a candy thermometer to get the caramel to the soft-ball stage, which seems a little more precise than the cold water test.</li>
</ul>
