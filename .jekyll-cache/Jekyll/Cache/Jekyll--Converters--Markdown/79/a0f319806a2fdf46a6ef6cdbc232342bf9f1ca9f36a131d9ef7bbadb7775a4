Iâ€™m nearly always disappointed by expensive cocktails, with the sole exception being a well made gin martini.  This drink is named after my father (â€œPanchoâ€).  He never had the opportunity to drink this elixer, but I know that he would have loved it.  The alchemy starts with this (easily doubled if youâ€™re drinking with your new best amigo):</p>
